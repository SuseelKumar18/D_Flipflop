# D_Flipflop

**Theory**

A D flip-flop, also known as a Data flip-flop or Delay flip-flop, is a synchronous sequential circuit used to store a single bit of data. It has a single data input D and a clock input CLK. The output of the D flip-flop, Q, follows the input D only at the triggering edge of the clock signal (usually the rising edge).

Working Principle
When the clock is LOW, the output Q retains its previous state (holds the data).

When the clock transitions to HIGH, the flip-flop captures the value present at the D input and updates the output Q accordingly.

The output Q' is always the complement of Q.

This behavior eliminates the invalid states present in SR flip-flops and prevents race conditions, making D flip-flops widely used in memory and storage applications.

Characteristic Table
Clock	D	Q (next state)	Description
0	X	Q (previous)	Hold (No change)
↑ (rising edge)	0	0	Reset (Q=0)
↑ (rising edge)	1	1	Set (Q=1)

This equation means that the next state of the output is equal to the input D at the clock's triggering edge.

Features
Acts as a 1-bit memory cell.

Prevents race conditions found in SR flip-flops.

Used extensively in registers, counters, and memory devices.

Can be edge-triggered (positive or negative edge) or level-triggered.

Summary
The D flip-flop reliably stores data synchronized with a clock signal. It transfers the input data to output only during the clock transitions, making it a fundamental building block in digital sequential logic.
